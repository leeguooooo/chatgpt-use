# chatgpt-use

> Turn your **ChatGPT web subscription** into a coding-agent backend — **no API key, no Codex billing.**
> Built on [`chrome-use`](https://github.com/leeguooooo/chrome-use), same lineage as [`chatgpt-imagegen`](https://github.com/leeguooooo/chatgpt-imagegen) and [`cookie-use`](https://github.com/leeguooooo/cookie-use).

Your Plus / Pro plan already includes a chat surface you've paid for. `chatgpt-use` drives that
**logged-in web conversation** through `chrome-use` — exactly the way `chatgpt-imagegen` drives image
generation — and wires it into your local machine. The result: a coding agent (Claude Code, Codex,
anything) can hand work to ChatGPT, and ChatGPT can read and edit your project files.

The web chat surface is **not the API** and **not the Codex-usage bucket**. So the work runs on quota
you've *already bought* — that's the whole point.

---

## Why this exists

| | API / `codex exec` | **chatgpt-use (web)** |
|---|---|---|
| Auth | `OPENAI_API_KEY` or Codex login | your normal browser login |
| Billing | per-token API spend / Codex-usage limit | **your flat monthly subscription** |
| File access | you build context plumbing | **`read_file` tool — no tunnel** |
| Setup | keys, env, gateways | `chrome-use` + a logged-in tab |

If you're already paying for ChatGPT Plus/Pro and *also* burning API credits or Codex-usage limits
from your coding agent, this closes the gap: route the cheap-and-already-paid work to the browser.

## Two modes

`chatgpt-use` is one engine — a `chrome-use`-driven **channel** to the ChatGPT web conversation (send a
message, wait for the reply, parse it) — exposed two ways depending on **who's the brain**.

### Mode 1 · 副手 / Sidekick — `chatgpt-use ask`

![sidekick](assets/mode1-sidekick.png)

**Your harness stays the brain.** Claude Code / Codex keeps planning and calling its own tools, and
delegates a single sub-task — reasoning, code generation, a review pass — to ChatGPT when it wants a
second brain. One round trip, no tool loop.

```bash
# one-shot: pipe context in, get an answer back
chatgpt-use ask "Review this diff for race conditions" --file src/server.rs

# or feed it whatever you already gathered
git diff | chatgpt-use ask "Explain what changed and what might break"
```

- The **caller** decides what context to send — `chatgpt-use` just relays it and returns ChatGPT's text.
- ChatGPT does **not** touch your machine in this mode.
- Borrows the web-driving practices proven in
  [`chatgpt-imagegen`](https://github.com/leeguooooo/chatgpt-imagegen): profile auto-detection
  (`relay` → logged-in profile), composer polling, rate-limit-dialog detection, in-page
  authenticated `fetch`, and conversation filing under a ChatGPT **Project**.

### Mode 2 · 大脑 / Brain — `chatgpt-use run`

![brain](assets/mode2-brain.png)

**ChatGPT is the brain; your machine is the hands.** A local agent loop — the same shape as Codex or
Claude Code — but the model is your web subscription:

1. `chatgpt-use` seeds the conversation with a **system prompt that defines a tool protocol**.
2. ChatGPT replies with a structured **tool call** (a fenced JSON block — see the caveat below).
3. The local harness **executes that tool** (`read_file`, `write_file`, `bash`, `grep`, `list_dir`, …)
   and feeds the observation back into the chat.
4. Loop until ChatGPT declares the task done.

```bash
chatgpt-use run "Add a --json flag to the status command and update the tests"
```

**This is why goal "let ChatGPT read my files" needs no tunnel and no exposed file server.** File
access *is* the `read_file` / `grep` tools: the local harness reads the bytes and hands them into the
conversation. ChatGPT never reaches back to your machine — it just asks, and the hands obey.

Mode 1 is a strict subset of Mode 2 (one turn, tools disabled), so they share the entire engine.

## How it works

```
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  chatgpt-use  (Rust CLI)                                         │
  │                                                                  │
  │   task ─▶ system prompt + tool protocol                          │
  │              │                                                   │
  │              ▼                                                   │
  │      ┌───────────────┐   eval/send/poll   ┌──────────────────┐   │
  │      │  agent loop   │ ─────────────────▶ │  chrome-use      │   │
  │      │  + tool exec  │ ◀───────────────── │  (logged-in tab) │   │
  │      └───────────────┘   parsed reply     └────────┬─────────┘   │
  │              │                                     │             │
  │     read_file/write_file/bash/grep         ChatGPT web chat      │
  │              ▼                              (your subscription)  │
  │        your project files                                       │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Everything page-side goes through `chrome-use eval <js>` (run JS in the page, get JSON back). Sending
a prompt = fill `#prompt-textarea` + click send. "Reply done" = poll until the stop/streaming control
disappears, watching for the *"Too many requests"* dialog. All proven in `chatgpt-imagegen`.

---

## The honest caveats

This is a clever hack on a surface that was never meant to be an API. We're upfront about it:

- **No native function-calling.** The web chat has no tool-call API (that's API-only). Tool calls are a
  **text protocol** we define in the system prompt and parse out of the reply. This is the make-or-break
  bet: it needs careful prompt design, robust parsing, and retries. Expect occasional malformed calls.
- **Rate limits are real.** Driving the one shared logged-in tab, the page rate-limits aggressively, so
  the channel runs at **concurrency 1** and queues across processes (flock), same as `chatgpt-imagegen`.
- **It's slower than the API.** You're waiting on a browser rendering a chat. Fine for offloading;
  not for tight latency loops.
- **ToS:** you are driving *your own* logged-in browser session. Use it within your plan's terms.
- **macOS first** (matches `chrome-use` / `cookie-use`); other platforms follow `chrome-use`.

## Install

> Distribution follows the GitHub-Release route (no npm, no token). Once the first binary ships:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leeguooooo/chatgpt-use/main/install.sh | sh
```

`chatgpt-use` **requires `chrome-use`** on `PATH`. If it's missing:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leeguooooo/chrome-use/main/install.sh | sh
```

Then make sure you have a Chrome profile logged in to chatgpt.com (or connect your live Chrome via
`chrome-use extension connect`).

---

## Usage cheatsheet

```bash
# Mode 1 — sidekick (harness is the brain)
chatgpt-use ask "<question>" [--file <path> ...] [--profile auto|relay|"Profile N"]

# Mode 2 — brain (ChatGPT drives local tools in a loop)
chatgpt-use run "<task>" [--cwd <dir>] [--approve] [--max-steps N]

# shared flags (mirroring chatgpt-imagegen)
#   --profile   auto (default) | relay | "Profile 3"
#   --session   reuse a chrome-use tab group across runs
#   --project   file the conversation under a ChatGPT Project
```

*(Flags are the design target; check `chatgpt-use --help` once built for the authoritative set.)*

## Roadmap

- [x] Design: two modes on one `chrome-use`-driven channel
- [ ] Channel core (send / poll / parse) — port the `chatgpt-imagegen` web practices to Rust
- [ ] Tool protocol + parser (`read_file`, `write_file`, `bash`, `grep`, `list_dir`)
- [ ] Mode 1 `ask` (one-shot, no tools)
- [ ] Mode 2 `run` agent loop + approval gate
- [ ] `install.sh` + GitHub-Release binaries
- [ ] Optional: a UI shell over the loop (TUI / menubar) for live progress & tool approval
