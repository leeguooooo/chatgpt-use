//! The shared engine: a `chrome-use`-driven channel to a logged-in ChatGPT web
//! conversation. Every mode goes through here. Port the proven web-driving
//! practices from chatgpt-imagegen (read its source at
//! /Users/leo/github.com/chatgpt-imagegen/chatgpt-imagegen):
//!   - locate the `chrome-use` binary; pick the browser (relay first, then a
//!     logged-in profile; honor `profile = auto|relay|"Profile N"`)
//!   - open chatgpt.com (optionally inside a ChatGPT Project), wait for the
//!     #prompt-textarea composer
//!   - submit a message; poll page state until the stop/streaming control
//!     disappears (reply complete); detect the "Too many requests" dialog
//!   - read the newest assistant message text/markdown back out
//! All page interaction goes through `chrome-use eval <js>` returning JSON.
//!
//! Concurrency is 1 (it drives the one shared logged-in tab and the page rate-
//! limits hard) — serialize across processes like chatgpt-imagegen does.
//!
//! Owned by the CORE agent.
